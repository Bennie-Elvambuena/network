# streamr-client

This is a JavaScript client for subscribing to realtime streams from [Streamr](http://www.streamr.com). Streamr is a realtime stream processing and analytics platform. This client allows you to write JS applications that leverage the stream computing and pub/sub features of Streamr. It works both in the browser and in node.js.

The streamr-client uses [socket.io](http://socket.io/) under the hood for streaming message delivery. It works in virtually all browsers by using websockets where available, or fallback methods on legacy browsers.

## Dependencies

* [socket.io-client](https://cdn.socket.io/socket.io-1.3.7.js)
* [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) (optional)

In node.js, dependencies will be installed automatically with `npm install`. In the browser, make sure you include `socket.io-client` before `streamr-client`.

## Usage

The `examples` directory contains snippets for both browser and node.js.

```javascript
client = new StreamrClient({ 
	// Connection options can be omitted, these are the default values
	server: 'https://data.streamr.com',
	autoConnect: true,
	autoDisconnect: true
})
var sub = client.subscribe(
	'stream-id', 
	function(message, streamId, timestamp, counter) {
		// Do something with the message, which is an object
	},
	{ 
		// Resend options, see below
	}
)
client.connect()
```

## Handling messages

The second argument to `client.subscribe(streamId, callback, resendOptions)` is the callback function that will be called for each message as they arrive. Its arguments are as follows:

Argument | Description
-------- | -----------
message  | A javascript object containing the message itself
streamId | The id of the stream the message belongs to
timestamp| (optional) A javascript Date object containing the timestamp for this message, if available.
counter  | (optional) A sequence number for this message, if available.


## Connection options

Option | Default value | Description
------ | ------------- | -----------
server | api.streamr.com | Address of the server to connect to.
autoConnect | true | If set to `true`, the client connects automatically on the first call to `subscribe()`. Otherwise an explicit call to `connect()` is required.
autoDisconnect | true Â | If set to `true`, the client automatically disconnects when the last channel is unsubscribed. Otherwise the connection is left open and can be disconnected explicitly by calling `disconnect()`.
transports | null | Override default transport selection / upgrade scheme. For example, value `["websocket"]` will force use of sockets right from the beginning, while value `["polling"]` will allow only long-polling to be used.


## Resend options

Note that only one of the resend options can be used for a particular subscription. The default functionality is to resend nothing, only subscribe to messages from the subscription moment onwards.

Option | Default value | Description
------ | ------------- | -----------
resend_all | undefined | Set to `true` if you want all the messages for the channel resent from the earliest available message.
resend_last | undefined | Resend the previous `N` messages.
resend_from | undefined | Resend from a specific message number.
resend_from_time | undefined | Resend from a specific Date (or millisecond timestamp).
resend_to | undefined | Can be used in conjunction with `resend_from` to limit the end of the resend. By default it is the newest message.

## Methods

Name | Description
---- | -----------
connect() | Connects to the server, and also subscribes to any streams for which `subscribe()` has been called before calling `connect()`.
disconnect() | Disconnects from the server, clearing all subscriptions.
pause() | Disconnects from the server without clearing subscriptions.
subscribe(streamId, callback, resendOptions) | Subscribes to a stream identified by the string `streamId`. Messages in this stream are passed to the `callback` function. See the above table for `resendOptions`. Returns a `Subscription` object.
unsubscribe(Subscription) | Unsubscribes the given `Subscription`.
unsubscribeAll(`streamId`) | Unsubscribes all `Subscriptions` for `streamId`.
getSubscriptions(`streamId`) | Returns a list of `Subscriptions` for `streamId`.
bind(eventName, function) | Binds a `function` to an event called `eventName`
unbind(eventName, function) | Unbinds the `function` from events called `eventName`

## Binding to events

The client and the subscriptions can fire events as detailed below. You can bind to them using `bind`:

```javascript
	function hello() {
		console.log('Hello!')
	}

	client.bind('connected', hello)

	var sub = client.subscribe(...)
	sub.bind('subscribed', function() {
		console.log('Subscribed to '+sub.streamId)
	})
```

You can unbind using `unbind`:

```javascript
	client.unbind('connected', hello)
```


## Events on the StreamrClient instance

Name | Handler Arguments | Description
---- | ----------------- | -----------
connected |  | Fired when the client has connected (or reconnected).
disconnected |  | Fired when the client has disconnected (or paused).

## Events on the Subscription object

Name | Handler Arguments | Description
---- | ----------------- | -----------
subscribed | {from: number} | Fired when a subscription request is acknowledged by the server.
unsubscribed |  | Fired when an unsubscription is acknowledged by the server.
resending |  | Fired when the subscription starts resending.
resent |  | Fired after `resending` when the subscription has finished resending.
no_resend |  | Fired after `resending` in case there was nothing to resend.

## Logging

This library supports the [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) library for logging.

In node.js, start your app like this: `DEBUG=StreamrClient node your-app.js`

In the browser, include `debug.js` and set `localStorage.debug = 'StreamrClient'`
