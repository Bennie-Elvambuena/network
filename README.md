# streamr monorepo

WIP.

## Contains

* network
* broker
* client
* protocol
* test-utils
* cli-tools

## Installation

Uses [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces), which requires npm v7.

Using `npm install` from the root directory should install all
workspace dependencies.

```
npm install
```

## Updating from Remotes

Temporary feature until monorepo becomes primary repo.

Merge remote changes from all remote repos:

```
make pull
```
